# Logistic-Prediction

<br> This project was part of the challenges given by an 8-week coding challenge held by Shopee Code League. This challenge was related to the logistic issue that happened in the Shopee Philippines. We were asked to predict each order, whether it was considered late or not, based on the given delivery period. This problem refers to data analytic indeed as we didn't build a model but perform simple but extensive mathematical calculations to predict each order, such as extracting the date information and comparing the order. 
<br> I was amazed by the result as I got almost 100% accurate result. On the final leaderboard, my submission scored 0.993 (the top team scored 1.00)
